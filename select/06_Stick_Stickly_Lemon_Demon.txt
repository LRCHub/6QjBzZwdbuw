I remember when I was just a boy
Summer afternoons would fill me up with joy

I'd sit right down and turn on the TV
Everyday I'd giggle mischeviously

I remember laughing like a buffoon
When I watched him on Nick in the afternoon

He was my favorite thing about Nick
Yes, that little popsicle Stick Stickly

And he'd sing
"Write to me Stick Stickly!"
"P.O. Box 963"
"New York City, New York State, 10108!"
10108

It's been years now (It's been years now)
Since his show has aired (Since his how has aired)
We sent a letter, it returned to sender
And now we're scared
Where'd he go?
What did they do with him
When they decided they were through with him?

Did they break him
Or burn him down for heat?
Were his googley eyes
Thrown out in the street?
Or is he fine?
That's what I'm praying!
I recall he was always saying
"Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down!"

And he'd sing
"Write to me Stick Stickly!"
"P.O. Box 963"
"New York City, New York State, 10108!"
And he'd sing
"Write to me Stick Stickly!"
"P.O. Box 963"
"New York City, New York State, 10108!"
10108!
